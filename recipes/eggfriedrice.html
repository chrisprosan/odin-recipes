    <p>
        Easy and delicious egg fried rice recipe that you can make with a nonstick skiller
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, thoroughly beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced crosswise</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add 1 tablespoon oil to a large non-stick skillet 
            and swirl to coat. Heat over high heat 
            until oil is shimmering. Add eggs to center of pan 
            and cook without moving until puffed and lightly browned 
            on one side, about 30 seconds. Fold eggs into a loose omelet 
            and push to the side of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan and swirl to coat. 
            Add rice to center of pan. Flip eggs on top of rice, then using 
            a wooden spoon, break the rice and eggs up, tossing and stirring 
            as you break them. Stir-fry until rice grains are loose and separated, 
            2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add soy sauce to the pan. Stir-fry until rice and eggs are evenly coated 
            in the soy sauce (the rice should be more or less broken up into distinct 
            grains without any large clumps). Add scallions. Remove from heat and toss 
            to combine. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.
        </li>
